### Abstract
Credit ratings predictions are extremely important in business, economics and finance. And with the drastic increase of data available to companies due to the advancement of technologies etc., companies are trying to leverage this abundance of data to make accurate informed decisions to maximize their profits and competitive advantage. Predicting the credit rating of a customer allows a financial institution to determine how to market various credit related products to current and future customers (should the data exist).
In this project we classify the credit ratings on 3 levels: Good, Standard, and Poor. We reduced the dimensions and features of our data to suit model training as well as modified our features to be numeric and scaled. We also made sure to not scale categorical (numeric) values where the scale is irrelevant. 
Using this cleaned and pre-processed data, we created 3 models to properly classify the credit rating of individuals. These include a KNN Classifier, a Random Forest Classifier, and a Support Vector Classifier. Each with their respective benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, we found that the Random Forest Classifier performed best when predicting the credit rating of unseen (test) data. Since accuracy is an important measure of how the financial institution would use these models we recommend using this model as it is most accurate.
